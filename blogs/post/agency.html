    <h2>NBA Summer on Fire While Free Agency Yet to Begin</h2>
       <p>You would think with the NBA finals being over things would start to quiet down a little bit while we wait for free agency to start and focus more on leagues like the MLB. Well that certainly isn’t the case since talks about what stars are going where have only went up tenfold since the NBA season officially ended. Whether it’s LeBron’s decision part 3, Paul George heading to the Lakers or staying in OKC, or even the rumors of Kyrie Irving leaving the Celtics in a year and possibly being traded due to non-commitment the buzz in the NBA has yet to end and now it’s got even bigger. News has come out that 2014 NBA finals MVP Kawhi Leonard wants out of San Antonio and so far, his preferred destinations are Los Angeles (Lakers or Clippers), the New York Knicks, and the Detroit Pistons. It’s understandable why Kawhi Leonard would want to go to LA and why a union with the Lakers would make the most sense.</p>

       <p>Leonard is from Los Angeles and the Lakers have the trade assets to make a deal happen while also having two max contract slots to pair him with two other stars who would most likely be LeBron James and Paul George. While you may have to give up guys like Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and possibly Kyle Kuzma there is no doubt that with those three stars as the centerpiece for the Lakers the storied franchise would be back to doing what they’ve been known to do throughout their historic history and that is be in contention for championships. keep in mind the Clippers have two lottery picks and could definitely be in play for a Kawhi Leonard deal. The problem with all of this is the Spurs have made it well known they will not trade Leonard to any team in the Western Conference. While the Knicks and Pistons are both on Leonard’s preferred destination list and obviously not in the Western Conference neither team will really have a trade package necessary to make a deal for Leonard.</p>

       <p>The Spurs most likely won’t have interest in Blake Griffin who has been injury prone throughout his NBA career and would need more than just Andre Drummond to make something happen. The Knicks may be more appealing due to the fact they can deal Kristaps Porzingis but it is unlikely they will be looking to part ways with their all-star forward. The Celtics are a team that weren’t on Leonard’s preferred list but will most likely be looking to make a deal as news has come out that they already attempted one during the NBA trade deadline. This is a team that could make more sense due to the fact that they have the trade assets and could deal Kyrie Irving who is uncertain to return after the 2019 season. The Spurs would probably want more than just Irving however to the point a deal may not be done here but none the less the Celtics look like the best trade partner to get a deal done.</p>

      <p>The most interesting part about this news is that Kawhi Leonard could shape how free agency ends up going depending on where he lands. Just yesterday Marc Stein of the New York Times was on ESPN’s Dan Le Batard Show and said the relationship between the Spurs and Kawhi Leonard was irreparable and he would be moving on one way or another because of it. Stein made this statement just after it was reported that Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich and Leonard would meet to repair their relationship and the organization would offer Leonard the super max while also noting they wouldn’t take any offers for Leonard as well. Stein also reported that it was very possible Paul George would stay in Oklahoma City and that he believed LeBron James would return to Miami this summer. How can this domino effect take place you ask?</p>

      <p>Simple the Heat’s President of Basketball Relations Pat Riley made it well known in his end of season presser that he’s in the business of competing for championships not just being a playoff team and every player on his roster was up for grabs in order to get a transcendent player back in Miami. The Heat will do everything possible to free up cap space this summer to help their future regardless of what happens this summer but Riley has shown the ability to get the impossible done and when you factor in the perception that Riley and the Heat have already made moves to try and repair their relationship with LeBron James and the theory that Kawhi Leonard could land in South Beach you’d have the formula that could bring LeBron back to Miami. With these two out of play combined with Paul George’s relationship with reigning league MVP Russell Westbrook along with wanting to win Steins report on George remaining in Oklahoma City could prove true. Keep in mind Leonard still has yet to talk to the Spurs and the super max being offered will be something that peaks the interest of Leonard and his camp. Don’t expect the Spurs to make a similar move that the Cavaliers made when they dealt Kyrie Irving to the Celtics.</p>

    <p>The Spurs will take their time with this situation and in the end could possibly end up not moving Leonard at all and dealing with it in similar fashion to how they dealt with the LaMarcus Aldridge situation last summer. Either way this NBA free agency could turn out to be one of the more exciting ones we’ve had in a while we’ll just have to wait and see.</p>
