      <h1 class="post-title">Kobe, Our Generations Jordan</h1>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p> I was only four years old when Michael Jordan had captured his sixth championship with the Chicago Bulls in 1998. Too young to process things, at that time I didn’t understand the magnitude of what Michael Jordan had accomplished or just the caliber of player his “airness” truly was during his career throughout the 80’s and 90’s but with Kobe Bryant that was a different story. Kobe was the son of Joe Bryant, a professional basketball player who spent numerous years playing for the Philadelphia 76ers. Kobe himself would go on to play for Lower Merion high school in Pennsylvania where he would become a McDonald’s All-American, win Naismith player of the year, and be recognized as the top player in the country as a senior. Bryant decided to skip college, choosing to head straight to the NBA draft in a move he would later note as what he thought would be his best opportunity to be able to play against his idol Michael Jordan.</p>

      <p> Bryant would go 14th overall to the Charlotte Hornets before being dealt on the same night to the Los Angeles Lakers in a deal orchestrated by the great Laker player turned GM Jerry West. Kobe Bryant didn’t see much playing time coming off the bench during his rookie season but flashed glimpses of greatness when he did. Paired with the most dominant force in basketball history in Shaquille O’Neal and one of the greatest coaches of all time in Phil Jackson, Kobe would go on to be a part of the next dynasty when he and the Los Angeles Lakers would 3-peat winning championships from 2000 through 2002.<p>


      <p> The band would start to disband as Shaq was dealt to Miami for a haul of players and picks leaving Kobe to solely command the ship. It came with some struggles but Bryant would find a way back to the promise land playing in three straight NBA finals and winning two more championships with his final coming in 2010 as he got over the hump that was the big three in Boston who had denied him another title back in 2008.</p>

       <p>Kobe Bryant was the closest thing to MJ that we had ever seen since the man revered as the greatest of all time had picked up a basketball. He wasn’t as athletic as Jordan and yet he still had the man’s game down to an exact T, redefining it with a mindset we’ve all come to know as Mamba mentality. It wasn’t the championships or the fact he was a part of one of the greatest duos in NBA history that made Kobe unique. He wasn’t the most talented or had the most complete game within the association.</p>

       <p>What made Kobe special was the fact that he was always going to outwork you. If you beat him once he was going to find a way to get you back. If you posed a threat he was going to find a way to crack the code. His first points scored as a pro were in Madison Square Garden, a place he’d later return to and set what was at the time a record for most points scored in MSG with 61 points.</p>

       <p>When his team needed him to get them a win against the Toronto Raptors in 2006 he put up 81, and on the final night of his professional basketball career in Staples Center he put up 60 points in a performance that was only fitting for the career of Kobe Bryant. A 5-time NBA champion, 2-time finals MVP, league MVP, and 18-time all-star, the man who sits at fourth all time on the NBA’s all-time scoring list will be inducted in to the basketball hall of fame at the end of this summer in a ceremony that will be much different than we expected.</p>
