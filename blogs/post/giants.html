      <h1 class="post-title">The New Look Giants</h1>
      <div class="post-content">


      <p>The New York football Giants were busy throughout the offseason after an extremely disappointing 2017 season that was filled with injuries and also saw them go 3-13 on the year while benching two-time Super Bowl MVP Quarterback Eli Manning and then later firing head coach Ben McAdoo. It was an uncharacteristic season for the Giants who have historically prided themselves on being a well-run organization. The team later moved on from long time General Manager Jerry Reece and Co-owner John Mara’s first move was to hire former Carolina Panther GM Dave Gettleman.</p>

     <p>The organizations next move was to hire Pat Shurmur as the next head coach of the team. Shurmur was the Offensive Coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings and had just come off a season that saw the Vikings go 13-3, finish first in the NFC North, and lose the NFC Championship game to the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

     <p>The Giants went into the offseason ready to attack all the problems they had faced during the 2017 season starting with their offensive line. They signed former Patriots left tackle Nate Solder who was arguably the best Tackle on the market while also bringing in Patrick Omameh and resigning John Greco and Brett Jones. They then went into the draft and took UTEP guard Will Hernandez in the second round which was looked at as a steal.</p>

    <p>The team also addressed it’s run game which had been nonexistent the last few seasons signing Jonathan Stewart who was the Carolina Panthers all-time leading rusher and using the second overall pick in the draft to take Penn States Saquon Barkley who was revered by many as the best player in the draft.</p>

    <p>Barkley is expected to be a major impact for the Giants out the gate and with his unique skillset of not only running the ball but also being able to block and catch as well could prove to be a major difference maker in 2018.</p>

    <p>Pat Shurmur is viewed by some as a Quarterback whisperer after what he was able to do with Case Keenum in Minnesota during the 2017 season and adding a player the caliber of Saquon Barkley will surely be an asset to veteran Quarterback Eli Manning who threw the ball more than any other Quarterback in the league last season. For the fans who were upset the Giants did not use the second overall pick on a Quarterback in this year’s draft to address the future of the position post Eli Manning they did draft Richmond Quarterback Kyle Lauletta in the fourth round of the draft.</p>

    <p>Lauletta was the MVP of the Senior Bowl and was rated as the seventh best Quarterback in the draft. Lauletta fits the mold of what head coach Pat Shurmur looks for in a QB noting that his decision making, timing, and accuracy are all up to par. The one knock on Lauletta however is his lack of arm strength which second year Giants Quarterback Davis Webb does have but Shurmur seems to believe that won’t be an issue.</p>

     <p>Lauletta and Webb will battle it out for the backup position at Quarterback this season but it is the belief by most that Webb will man the backup position behind Eli Manning while Lauletta spends the year learning and getting used to the league similar to what Webb spent the 2017 season doing. With the return of dynamic Wide Receiver Odell Beckham Jr coming back from injury as well as Tight End Evan Engram heading into his second year and many around the organization believing receiver Sterling Shephard will have a big year for the Giants on top of the addition of Running back Saquon Barkley it’s hard to see how opposing teams will be able to cover the Giants offense this upcoming season.</p>

       <p>Veteran Quarterback Eli Manning has taken much flack for his performances during the last few regular seasons but worked with virtually no running game and an abysmal offensive line which won’t look to be the case this season. The Giants have a pro bowl caliber player at virtually every position heading into this season and it is for this reason that both Giants and NFL fans alike should be prepared for a resurgence from the big blue this season.</p>
