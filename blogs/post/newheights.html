        <div class="post-content">

          <p>When the Iowa Hawkeyes set the attendance record at Kinnick stadium most fans probably thought to themselves can it get any bigger than this? Just about six years to the date of this transcendent event the Hawkeyes and Cowboys are looking to change the game again. This time the two historical powers will do battle at the home of the Texas Rangers, Globe Life Field. Not only will fans get to see this historic rivalry at new heights, but it will be joined with a dual meet from the United States and Iran. The United States is coming off a runner up finish at both the Olympics and 2021 World championships with Iran finishing just behind.</p>


          <p>The story lines for this event are endless from who will be where on the Cowboy and Hawkeye teams to the questions on what we can expect from two fully loaded senior level squads going head to head in a dual meet. When asked what fans and media can expect from the Hawkeye squad, head coach Tom Brands said “we are benefiting from the Covid year and there are a lot more story lines in our room”. Cowboys head coach John Smith expects his team to be hitting on all cylinders by January and followed up Brands comments by saying The Cowboys are a deep team and he has confidence in a few wrestlers coming in to step up if need be. Smith noted that his team needs to get better when it comes to competing with Iowa admitting Brands comments woke him up and he will relay them to his team. Iran is expected to bring their number ones to do battle with the United States according to Rich Bender making this event even more of a can’t miss.</p>

          <p>What can’t get lost in this is the magnitude of this event overall is what it will do for the landscape of wrestling both domestically and internationally. Yes, the powers at be competing in Globe Life stadium is huge but what should also be spoken on is the setting of the event and its ripple effects. During the events press conference USA Wrestling executive director Rich Bender made the statement “wrestling is on the precipice of its golden age”. This statement couldn’t be further from the truth as participation levels have risen, coverage of the sport has gone up, and the competitive gap on both the senior level and collegiate wrestling has narrowed. No more are the days of teams like Russia running away with team championships without a fight. </p>


          <p>The same can be said for division one wrestling as we’ve seen Penn State enter the race of national power winning the last eight of 10 national championships with teams like Ohio State not falling far behind these three programs as well. The event itself will put wrestling center stage in a state where Football has reigned supreme. Wrestling has been on a steady incline in the state of Texas with the likes of Bo Nickel, AJ Ferrari, and Tamyra Mensah-Stock going onto have success both nationally and internationally in recent memory. Recruiting in the state of Texas has gotten better over the years but this event will now showcase the sport to fans who may have not had a keen eye to wrestling in the past. Tickets for this event will be available Thursday October 14th at 10 AM EST through the Texas Rangers website.</p>
