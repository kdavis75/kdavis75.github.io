      <div class="post-content">

        <p>While growing up in the town of Parkersburg, West Virginia, University of Miami's Amy Deem said her parents had one rule when it came to sports “if you start something you finish, no matter what it is if you start it you finish”.</p>

        <p>Whether it was just a friendly competition between family or during her time as a Track and field athele at Ohio State University, her parents words stuck with her from that small town in West Virginia to the University of Miami's campus.</p>

        <p>Deem’s UM journey started almost 30 years ago when she arrived on UM's campus in 1988 for what was supposed to be only a six-week internship.</p>

        <p>"We had a big break from thanksgiving to January. So, I came down to do an internship. My athletic trainer who rehabbed my knee got a full-time job; she was a GA here. So, I came when she came here. I talked to her and she said it would be fine," Said Deem "So, I set up an internship to work the six weeks over the Christmas break, and it would end at the Orange Bowl. and then after that, they offer me a full-time internship."</p>

        <p>That internship would turn into a full-time assistant coaching job. When Deem first joined UM’s coaching staff they had 0 champions and no Hurricanes had ever recorded an NCAA qualifying mark. It took her only two years as an assistant before she was promoted to head coach in 1990. And since taking over the program full time the Hurricanes have been one of the most successful track and field programs in the nation.</p>

        <p>Deem has led Miami to 14 national championships, 14 conference team titles and more than 200 of her athletes have won First Team All-America honors. She also coached the USA women's track team during the 2012 London Olympics. The team won six gold medals, four silver, and four bronze that year.</p>

        <p>Her success also led to another promotion in 2008 when she was awarded the title “Director of Track and Field”. Making her the first female in UM History to do so and only one out of six across the country to be the head coach of both the men's and women's track and field teams.</p>

        <p>“I love the challenges of coaching the men and the women. Men and women bring a completely different motivation, not motivation, but a completely different; for the most part “attitude”. She said when asked about what it’s like coaching both genders. “It's basically only swimming and track where you do have that cross. Where you have one head coach over both genders, but I like it. I think it helps the chemistry on both sides and I mean it’s challenging but at the same time, I enjoy having both genders a lot.”</p>

        <p>In 2017 she was also inducted into the United States Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Associations (USTFCCA) coaches Hall of Fame.</p>

        <p>But regardless of the success she has had over the years the words that her parents ingrained in her growing up have always stuck with her.</p>

        <p>“if you start it, you finish it.” and coach Deem feels despite her age and success, her UM journey is not finished just yet.</p>

        <p>“if you look at how long I've coached, It looks like retirement would be something I would consider. 30 years is a long time to be in the same perfection, to do the same thing. But if you look at how old I am, still a good proportion of my life left. I started when I was so young.” She said, "I still feel to this day that there are more things we can achieve,"</p>

        <p>“I always have goals to continue to win, you know. ACCs to be able to win it as much as possible, to win a team title and the NCAA championships to continue to develop our men's program so that it has the level of success that our women have.”</p>

        <p>But Deem says her motivation to continue has less to do with winning and more to do with the impact she can have on her young athletes’ lives.</p>

        <p>“Clearly, I love to win but you can't be in this profession for 30 years if it's all about winning, you'll have screwed up, you've done something along the lines to not be in this position,” she said “I love being around young people. I love making a difference. I love when the light bulb goes off when something clicks, you know like they work so hard for something and it comes to fruition”</p>

        <p>And although the rise of social media and other things have made connecting with the younger generation more challenging, coach Deems impact can still be felt on her young players.</p>

        <p>“She’s been a huge part, I feel like she was really that thing that got me to the next level this year for track,” said freshman sprinter Jacious Sears, "I think I've been missing a lot of things like form-wise and speed wise and she has just helped me a lot with that and she was a big part of me placing at ACCs and everything." </p>

        <p>She has also found ways to still have a huge impact on some of her former athletes lives as well.</p>

        <p>“Coach Deem is more than a Coach, she can easily step into the role of mentor, mom or girlfriend depending on the scenario. I love that our relations has evolved over time and she has always given me space to be my unique self,” said Lauryn Williams, who Deem coached during her time at UM from 2001-04 and also in the 2012 Olympics. “She has been the best example of authenticity in my life. Do that is right always and honest even when it is uncomfortable.” </p>

        <p>Deem doesn’t know when her story will be finished but one thing she does know is that she’ll be coaching for as long as she can. </p>

        <p>“my motivation is definitely still there!” Said Deem “So, as long as I feel like I can make a difference and influence in a positive way on young people and I'm not holding the program back then I'll continue to coach as long as I can.”</p>
