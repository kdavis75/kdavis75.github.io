       <h1 class="post-title">Rich and Kayson’s Way Too Early NBA Picks and Predictions</h1>
       <div class="post-content">
         <p> With an offseason that saw the most turnover between teams and players in NBA history, we came away with what looks to be the end of a dynasty and a number of dynamic duos on teams which will all have a shot to compete for an NBA title this season. This past NBA draft also saw three (possibly more) players who are expected to be franchise changing corner stones. With all this excitement to start the season here are our way too early NBA picks and predictions.</p>

         <h2>ROY</h2>

       <h3>Rich</h3> – <p>With Zion Williamson expected to be out for a month plus to start the NBA season it makes for a much more interesting race then previously predicted. Both RJ Barrett of the New York Knicks and Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies have gotten off to good starts to their rookie campaigns with Morant already recording a 30-point game and Barrett averaging 21 points while also recording a 15-rebound game. But a name I don’t think anyone saw entering this race comes from a Miami Heat rookie. No, it isn’t 13th overall pick Tyler Herro, (though I believe he will be in this race as well) it’s actually an undrafted rookie by the name of Kendrick Nunn. Nunn spent his first year as a pro in the Warriors G league system before being snagged by the Heat at the end of last season making him rookie eligible this season.<p>

       <p>Nunn not only leads all rookies in scoring with 22 points but through the Heat’s first 3 games he led the team in scoring as well, while shooting 52 percent from the field and 42 percent from three-point range. Nunn is also one of five players (all four are hall of famers) in NBA history to score 67 + points while shooting at least 51.9 percent from the field in their first three games. If he can keep this rate of play up he will be my Rookie of the year pick.</p>

      <h3>Kayson</h3> – <p>I guess the easy pick is Zion Williamson, but with him set to miss the first two months of the season, I think this race could get interesting, I like what I’ve seen from Coby White so far, who’s my sleeper pick here but I’m going with the safe pick and taking Ja Morant. Zion would be my real pick here but since he going to miss about 30 games, that might make it hard for him to win it especially if someone like Ja Morant gets off to a hot start. It’ll be hard for Zion to catch up, coming off an injury.<p>

      <h2>MVP</h2>
       <h3>Rich</h3> – <p>I believe two of the top three MVP candidates will remain the same with that being 2017-18 MVP James Harden of the Houston Rockets, and reigning league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. Harden has averaged 29 points through his first three games but has struggled finding his shooting stroke so far this season shooting 28 percent from the field and 15 percent from three-point range (something I don’t expect to continue). Giannis on the other hand has averaged 24-13-9 through his first three games shooting 52 percent from the field. My league MVP pick however will be NBA champion and finals MVP Kawhi Leonard. Leonard has averaged 27 through his first three games to go along with 6 rebounds and 7 assists while also getting it done on both ends of the floor. I believe Kawhi will lead the clippers to the best record in the league this season making him my pick for league MVP.</p>

     <h3>Kayson</h3>– <p>When I first thought about this, I instantly thought Giannis Antetokounmpo, but on second
     thought, I am going with a lowkey sleeper pick …. Kawhi Leonard. I know the first thing
       everyone is thinking &quot;but he’s not going to play in enough games.&quot; but I actually think he might.
      Paul George wouldn’t be returning until sometime in mid-Nov. and when he does it’s not like the
     Los Angeles Clippers can just start resting Leonard. Leonard and George will have to spend time
     on the court together to build chemistry and that can’t happen if Leonard starts to miss games as
    soon as George comes back so, I think it’ll be some time around mid-season before Leonard
    starts getting DNPs for &quot;Load Management.&quot; I expect the Clippers to be one of the top teams in
    the west plus, there is only one thing Leonard hasn’t done yet and that’s win regular-season MVP
     and what better time than the present?</p>

      <h2>Best Duo</h2>

      <h3>Rich</h3> – <p>Of the many NBA duos that came to form this offseason my pick for the best among them is going to have to be LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Even in year 17 while not quite the player he was a few years ago LeBron James hasn’t lost much as he approaches the age of 35 in December. He’s averaging 23-7-10 through his first three games and has even given more effort on the defensive end of the floor which is something we haven’t typically seen from him till the postseason these last few years. Anthony Davis on the other hand is averaging 25-10-3 through the first three games of the season while shooting 43 percent from the field. Both of these players are regarded as top five players in the league right now and have averaged a combined 50 points to go along with excellent rebounding skills between them.</p>

      <p>Between the eye test as well as the numbers these two are both capable of putting up I find it hard to believe there are many teams if any who will be able to stop this duo going forward especially once they fully figure each other out.</p>

      <h3>Kayson</h3> – <p>I think you guys know who I’m going with here, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. I think the loss against the Bucks was an encouraging one, to say the least. The Rockets were up for most of the game and at one point held a 16 point lead in the second half, all that with harden shooting 2 of 13 for the game. Westbrook wasn’t having the best game either until the 11-minute mark of the fourth quarter when he scored 11 of Houston 12 points before coach Mike D’Antoni took him out with four minutes left. Which is a move that still does not make sense to me but if you told me on a night where Harden and Eric Gordon go a combined 4 for 30 from three, that the Rocket would have a 16 lead and a chance to win the game I would think that’s a lie. Westbrook and Harden also combined for 21 assists and 23 rebounds, I can see multiple games where both Harden and Westbrook finish the game with a Triple Double.</p>

      <h2>Best Team in The West</h2>

      <h3>Rich</h3> – <p>This is a pick that has to be obvious right? If I’m calling Kawhi Leonard the league MVP while claiming to believe he’ll lead the Clippers to the best record in the NBA it’s only right I say the Clippers will be the best team in the Western Conference. The Clippers were already a tough nosed in your face defensive minded team last season finishing with 48 wins in the west last season. They’ve since added two-time NBA champion and two time finals MVP Kawhi Leonard along with multiple time all-star Paul George to their roster. They’re arguably the deepest team in the league with a bench that is capable of scoring 30-40 points on a given night and have a legitimate case to have a player at each position in their starting five make an all-defensive team this season. These aren’t the Clippers we’ve all been accustomed to watching over the last couple of decades, they’re a different breed which is why they’re my choice for best team in the Western conference.</p>

      <h3>Kayson</h3> – <p>I have to go with the Los Angeles Clippers here. I think their first two games of the season showed us that the Clippers are a force to be reckoned with, and the team hasn’t even added All-star forward Paul George to the team yet. They are elite on defense; they play hard and are extremely well-coached. I just don’t see any other team in the west that’s as well rounded as the Clippers are this year.</p>

     <h2>Which teams make it to the final</h2>

     <h3>Rich</h3> – <p>With everything I’ve talked about here between the Lakers duo, the Sixers being the best team in the east along with my multiple takes on the Clippers and their players, I think I’ve narrowed this down to who I believe is coming out of each conference. I actually believe we get a full seven game series between the Bucks-Sixers in the Eastern conference finals and another full seven in an all LA Western conference finals. I believe the Sixers size will impose a challenge to the Bucks and they’ll implement a similar game plan on Giannis that the Toronto Raptors used on him in last years conference finals to come out of the east while on the wests side of things, we got a glimpse into what the Clippers can do to the Lakers and that was without Paul George. The Lakers have the best duo in the league, this will be an all out battle the fans will love watching but the Clippers coaching along with their depth will prove the difference against the Lakers.</p>

     <h3>Kayson</h3> – <p>This one is tough because it’s hard to see who will come out the west when it’s all said and done. Since almost everyone expects the Eastern Conference Finals to be the Bucks vs 76ers, I think I’ll start there. I’m picking the Bucks to make it to the finals. The Bucks have more shooting around Giannis. I see a lineup where the Bucks put Giannis at point Guard with Matthews, Lopez, Middleton, and Korver or Ilyasova giving Giannis enough shooting to attack the paint without defenses over helping. Making it out the west will be the Clippers. They have two guys they can throw at Lebron James in a playoffs series to wear him down, meaning the series will come down to the role players and that is advantage Clippers. In a potential Rockets versus Clippers series, I think Harden and Westbrook will struggle with Leonard and George’s defense plus add in Patrick Beverley and again advantage Clippers.</p>

     <h2>NBA Champions Pick</h2>

    <h3>Rich</h3> –  I believe we will see Kawhi Leonard lead the Clippers to their first conference finals appearance, first NBA finals appearance, and their first NBA championship as he continues to make his stake at all time great status winning his third championship with a third franchise. the Clippers veteran experience and depth will prove the difference against a very good but still young 76ers team.

    <h3>Kayson</h3> – It’ll be another Kawhi vs Giannis match-up and I think it’ll be more of the same from last year’s Eastern Conference Finals. Though I do think Giannis will play better this time around after learning from last year, I still think the Clippers win the series. Kawhi takes home his third finals MVP, Clippers get their first NBA Championship, and the rest of the NBA spends the summer trying to figure out what to do with this team’s defense and debating if Kawhi is now the best player in the league.

     <h2>Bold Prediction for The Season</h2>

   <h3>Rich</h3> – <p>Jimmy Butler joining the Miami Heat will be something that pushes the Heat back into upper echelon in the eastern conference. The Heat have a collection of talent (both vets and young) who play the exact style team president Pat Riley has instituted with his former teams as a coach and continued to push as an executive. I believe Butler’s presence is only going to galvanize this team and they’re players to jump to another level and because of this I predict the Miami Heat will finish top three in the Eastern conference.</p>

  <h3>Kayson</h3> – <p>OKC gets the 8th seed in the west. Enough said!</p>
