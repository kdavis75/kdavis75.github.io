      <h2>Kobe, Our Generations Jordan</h2>
      <p>I was only four years old when Michael Jordan had captured his sixth championship with the Chicago Bulls in 1998. Too young to process things, at that time I didn’t understand the magnitude of what Michael Jordan had accomplished or just the caliber of player his “airness” truly was during his career throughout the 80’s and 90’s but with Kobe Bryant that was a different story. Kobe was the son of Joe Bryant, a professional basketball player who spent numerous years playing for the Philadelphia 76ers.</p><a href="../blogs/post/kobe.html">Continue Reading --></a>

       <h2>Rich and Kayson’s Way Too Early NBA Picks and Predictions</h2>
       <p>With an offseason that saw the most turnover between teams and players in NBA history, we came away with what looks to be the end of a dynasty and a number of dynamic duos on teams which will all have a shot to compete for an NBA title this season. This past NBA draft also saw three (possibly more) players who are expected to be franchise changing corner stones.

      <h2>The New Look Giants</h2>
      <p>The New York football Giants were busy throughout the offseason after an extremely disappointing 2017 season that was filled with injuries and also saw them go 3-13 on the year while benching two-time Super Bowl MVP Quarterback Eli Manning and then later firing head coach Ben McAdoo. It was an uncharacteristic season for the Giants who have historically prided themselves on being a well-run organization. The team later moved on from long time General Manager Jerry Reece and Co-owner John Mara’s first move was to hire former Carolina Panther GM Dave Gettleman.</p><a href="../blogs/post/giants.html">Continue Reading --></a>

      <h2>NBA Summer on Fire While Free Agency Yet to Begin</h2>
      <p>You would think with the NBA finals being over things would start to quiet down a little bit while we wait for free agency to start and focus more on leagues like the MLB. Well that certainly isn’t the case since talks about what stars are going where have only went up tenfold since the NBA season officially ended. Whether it’s LeBron’s decision part 3, Paul George heading to the Lakers or staying in OKC, or even the rumors of Kyrie Irving leaving the Celtics in a year and possibly being traded due to non-commitment the buzz in the NBA has yet to end and now it’s got even bigger.</p><a href="../blogs/post/agency.html">Continue Reading --></a>
